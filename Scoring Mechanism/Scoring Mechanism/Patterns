This code uses the following design patterns:

1) Structure - used to store information about tasks.
2) Class - used to store and evaluate the results of tasks.
3) Composite - used to store a list of tasks in the form of a vector.
4) Map - used to store the results of each student in the form of a key-value (student name - list of results).
5) Iterator - used to go through the list of tasks and student results.
